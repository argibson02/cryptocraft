Init time set array loads on app load (28 points) time helpers

When buy :
    {
    get quantity
    get unix timestamp (real one)
    }

arr or obj
------
run funciton (
    compares that unix stamp with the unix int
        find the one that has the smallest diff


        var tempHolding :
        for (var i = 0; i < unixint.length; i++) {
            diff = int - stamp
            Math.adbs(diff)
    `       if (diff < templholding){
                tempholding = diff;
            }
